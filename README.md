# Bio5202-Analysis-Tutorial

Five main files are included in this repository:
  1. "PBailey_AnalysisTutorial_Morphometrics.R" -> R file that contains code to tidy & format data, along with GPA & PCA
  2. "PBailey_AnalysisTutorial.pptx" -> PWPT presentation of analyses
  3. "PBailey_AnalysisTutorial_FINAL.docx" -> Word document of the analysis/biological significance
  4. "OutputData.csv" -> CSV containing sample names, Procrustes distances, centeroids, and X, Y, Z coordinates for 268 landmarks [804 total landmarks] across 148 individual skulls
  5. "Classifiers.csv" -> CSV containing sample name, biological group, species, sex, and centeroid

Note: All data has been randomized using R functions; because of this, meaningful names may be replaced with generic characters. Due to this, interpretation of results via randomized data may be difficult, but process is preserved.
